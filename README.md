# Clustering and Deep Learning in R -2018

I worked for a major container shipping company's Miami office and was requested to optimize their quoting system.

1- Situation: 
  There was no systematic way to define quoting for a certain client. It was very ad-hoc and would take too long.

2- Task: 
  Build a clusters for clients based on commodity transported, volume and portpair (port of loading -> port of destination). This way when a client requested a quote based on those three variables, there was a quote range well defined based on those clusters.

3- Actions:
  - Data cleaning to enable data quality and integrity using excel VBA routines. 
  - Meetings with major stakeholders for context and validation of variables. 
  - Actual building of model and testing results.
  - Using siluette method to determin number of clusters
  - Associate clusters to prices
  - Meeting with stakeholders to validate the results

4- Results:
  - Reduced quoting time in around 75% - from an average of 4 days to 1 day.
  - Was later implemented in all offices around the world.
