# internship-2018
codes for my internship in 2018 during my masters degree in Data Science

I worked for a major container shipping company and was requested to optimize their quoting system.

1- Issue: 
  There was no systematic way to define pricing for a certain client. It was very ad-hoc and would take too long.

2- Proposed Solution: 
  Cluster clients based on commodity transported, volume and portpair (port of loading -> port of destination)

3- There was a lot of data cleaning involved since the data warehouse was maintained by a third party and had no reliability and had terrible quality. Most of the cleaning was made in excel and automated in VBA.
